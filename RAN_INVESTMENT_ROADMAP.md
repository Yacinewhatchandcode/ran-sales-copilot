## Q2 2026: "The Auto-Execution Layer" 
**Status: R&D & Integration Design**
_Objective: Remove the human from the copy-paste loop. Output becomes Action._
*   **Feature 1 (CRM Sync):** Build native OAuth apps for Salesforce and HubSpot. RAN automatically logs Pain Points, Objections, and Deal Probabilities directly into the specific CRM Contact/Deal object.
*   **Feature 2 (SDR Automation):** Integration with GSuite/Outreach. The moment RAN designates a 3-step SDR sequence, an API trigger puts the sequence directly into Draft status in the assigned rep’s Gmail.
*   **Feature 3 (Vector Memory):** Long-term historical Deal Database. RAN begins understanding _why_ deals fall through across months, updating its prompt weights based on company-wide empirical closing ratios.

## Q3 2026: "The Real-Time Voice Clone Assistant"
**Status: Blueprint Architecture**
_Objective: Latency-free Whispers. Pre-emptive Strike Capabilities._
*   **Feature 1 (Live Listening):** Move from Post-Call `.txt` uploads to WebRTC/API socket integrations inside Zoom/Google Meet.
*   **Feature 2 (The Ear-Piece):** Real-Time Transcription (Whisper v3). As the prospect speaks, RAN actively pushes Objection Handling Reversals to the SDR’s screen in under 600ms.
*   **Feature 3 (Voice Authentication Bias):** The agent learns the prospect's tone dynamically. It identifies frustration spikes instantly and prompts the human SDR to "slow down, pivot to empathy."

## Q4 2026: "The Autonomous Closer"
**Status: Vision Scale (The Ultimate Multi-Agent Environment)**
_Objective: Total Commercial Autonomy for Micro-Ticket Sales._
*   **Feature 1 (The AI SDR Call Center):** RAN gains a mouth. Utilizing Qwen3-TTS and live inference, RAN will actively call prospects, handle objections using its trained vector memory, and book the meeting directly into the Calendly of the Account Executive.
*   **Feature 2 (Predictive Fund-Raising Metrics):** RAN connects global closed-won ratios against internal MRR metrics to automatically auto-generate financial scaling pitch decks for startup boards based purely on sales agent telemetry.
*   **End-of-Year ARR Goal:** Scale to 120+ active enterprise sub-accounts utilizing the infrastructure.
