# THE WEDGE: 10-Minute Live Demo Pitch
**Target:** VP of Sales, CRO, Head of Revenue Operations.
**Objective:** Break their confidence in their current SDR/Closing processes. Prove immediate, mathematically visible value in under 10 minutes using their own data.

## Phase 1: The Hook & Pattern Break (0-2 Minutes)
_Goal: Establish authority. Do not pitch features. Pitch the gap._

"I appreciate the time, [Name]. I’m not here to walk you through a slide deck about how great our AI is. Every vendor does that.
Instead, I want to talk about the 30% of deals your team is currently losing between the *Discovery* phase and the *Proposal* phase.
Most Sales Directors think it’s a pipeline volume problem. It’s not. It’s an objection-handling problem. Your reps are missing the micro-emotional shifts that dictate whether a deal is closed or lost.

Let me prove it to you right now. You have a raw call transcript from a recent deal you either lost or that stalled out, correct? Good.
Let's see what RAN sees that your reps missed."

## Phase 2: The Action & Injection (2-5 Minutes)
_Goal: Shift from passive listening to active, high-stakes verification._

**[Action: You open the RAN Sales Co-Pilot Private Beta dashboard.]**
"This is RAN. It's not a generic summarization tool. It's a strategic pricing and closing engine.
I’m going to drag and drop the `.txt` transcript of that stalled deal directly into the engine, right here."
**[Action: Drop the file. Hit "Analyze Call".]**

"While this runs (it takes about 4 seconds), understand what is happening:
RAN is running a MEDDIC framework analysis against the exact words your prospect said, mapping authority gaps, budget resistance, and identifying the exact 'Target Persona' pain points."

## Phase 3: The Epiphany (5-8 Minutes)
_Goal: Reveal the matrix. Make them feel exposed but relieved that you have the solution._

**[Action: The Dashboard Loads with the 8 UI Sections.]**

"Look at this.

**1. Objection Detection:** Look at Point #2 here. Did your rep address this specific budget concern? Usually, they skip it to get to the demo. That's why the deal stalled.
**2. Emotional Shifts:** At 14:30 in the call, RAN detected a 'Defensive' tone shift. What did your rep say right before that? They pushed for the close too early.
**3. The Exact Reversal Script:** Here is the real return on investment. Look at 'Section 6: Closing Strategy'. RAN just wrote the 3-sentence script your SDR needs to send *today* to resurrect this exact deal. I didn’t write this. The machine derived it mathematically from the prospect's vocabulary."

## Phase 4: The Close & Scale (8-10 Minutes)
_Goal: Transition the "Wow" moment into a financial commitment constraint._

"We used one transcript, and we immediately generated a targeted reversal script to save a deal.
Now, imagine doing this for all 2,000 calls your SDR team makes this month.
Imagine RAN automatically feeding this sequence (point to Section 7) directly into HubSpot before the rep even hangs up the phone.

How much is a lost deal costing you every month?
We are opening the Private Beta for 5 founding teams today. The Founding Members pricing is locked for life. Let's get your SDR team onboarded by tomorrow afternoon."
